title:  "Why I choose Linux Mint as my daily driver?"
---

The only reason I use a Linux distro against macOS is I cannot install WeChat (or at least difficult to install), so that I can concentrate on my programming (just joking). 

After trying many Linux distros (e.g. Ubuntu, Fedora, Manjaro, PopOS, etc), Linux Mint is where I finally landed due to its appearance, stability, software support, etc.
